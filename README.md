## Physics

The balloon is a set of a particles connected to each other with linear springs.\
The pressure is represented as P = k(V / V<sub>0</sub> â€“ 1).

The forces applied to particles:

## Simulation

The simulation is written in Typescript and supports two parameters.
The number of particles in a model and a radius of the balloon.
